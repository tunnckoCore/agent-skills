# Google Workspace CLI (`gws`)

Interact with Google Workspace services via the `gws` CLI. This skill covers
all supported services, helper shortcuts, cross-service workflows, role-based
personas, and multi-step recipes.

## Installation & Auth

The `gws` binary must be on `$PATH`. Version: 0.16.0+.

```bash
# Check status - if not logged - try with source ~/.config/gws/env - if not, report to the user
gws auth status
```

### Auth Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--readonly` | Request read-only scopes |
| `--full` | Request all scopes incl. pubsub + cloud-platform |
| `--scopes` | Comma-separated custom scopes |
| `-s, --services` | Limit scope picker to specific services (e.g. `-s drive,gmail`) |

## CLI Syntax

```bash
gws <service> <resource> [sub-resource] <method> [flags]
```

### Global Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--format <FMT>` | Output format: `json` (default), `table`, `yaml`, `csv` |
| `--dry-run` | Validate locally without calling the API |
| `--sanitize <TEMPLATE>` | Screen responses through Model Armor |
| `--params '{"key": "val"}'` | URL/query parameters |
| `--json '{"key": "val"}'` | Request body |
| `-o, --output <PATH>` | Save binary responses to file |
| `--upload <PATH>` | Upload file content (multipart) |
| `--page-all` | Auto-paginate (NDJSON output) |
| `--page-limit <N>` | Max pages with --page-all (default: 10) |
| `--page-delay <MS>` | Delay between pages in ms (default: 100) |

### Discovering Commands

```bash
gws <service> --help                    # Browse resources and methods
gws schema <service.resource.method>    # Inspect params, types, defaults
```

## Shell Tips

- **zsh `!` expansion:** Use double quotes for sheet ranges: `--range "Sheet1!A1:D10"`
- **JSON with double quotes:** Wrap `--params`/`--json` in single quotes: `--params '{"pageSize": 5}'`

## Security Rules

- **Never** output secrets (API keys, tokens) directly
- **Always** confirm with user before executing write/delete commands
- Prefer `--dry-run` for destructive operations
- Use `--sanitize` for PII/content safety screening
