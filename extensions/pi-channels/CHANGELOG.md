## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added

- OpenAI transcription now automatically uses pi's built-in OpenAI authentication if available (no need for explicit `apiKey` in config)
- Users who have run `/login openai` can enable transcription without additional configuration
- Sync bot commands with Telegram on startup (populates the `/command` menu in Telegram)
- Slack and Telegram adapters now validate that `text` is present before sending

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** `env:VAR_NAME` substitution in settings is no longer supported. Set secret values (tokens, API keys) directly in `settings.json` instead of using `"env:..."` references.
- Adapter factories are now async to support modelRegistry API key resolution
- Transcription providers use static `create()` factory methods instead of constructors

### Fixed

- Fix broken Telegram voice transcription: convert Ogg Opus to M4A via ffmpeg before passing to Apple SFSpeechRecognizer (which has poor Ogg Opus support)
- Use RunLoop instead of DispatchSemaphore in Swift transcriber — fixes callback delivery hang where recognition results were never received
- Renamed Swift helper to `transcribe-apple-v2.swift` to force recompilation after the RunLoop fix
- Relaxed `requiresOnDeviceRecognition` to `false` — allows fallback to online recognition when on-device model is unavailable

## [0.1.1] - 2026-02-19 (7442720)

### Added

- Support custom JSON payloads in webhook adapter via `notify` tool
- Add explicit webhook payload controls: `payloadMode` (`envelope`/`raw`), `rawBody`, and per-message webhook overrides (`method`, `contentType`)

### Fixed

- Guard `notify` JSON parsing and return graceful `Invalid JSON` errors instead of throwing
- Remove metadata side-channel payload switching (`metadata["json"]`) in favor of typed fields
- Allow raw JSON sends without injecting empty `text` into outgoing messages
- Omit request body for webhook `GET`/`HEAD` requests to avoid undici runtime errors
- Omit `Content-Type` for bodyless `GET`/`HEAD` webhook requests
- Prevent silent raw payload drops by rejecting `GET`/`HEAD` requests that include `json/rawBody`
- Add `HEAD` method support to the `notify` tool
- Document `contentType` precedence over `headers["Content-Type"]` for webhook config

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-17 (7839f93)
