## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-06

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** `env:VAR_NAME` substitution in settings is no longer supported. Set `clientId` and `clientSecret` directly in `settings.json` instead of using `"env:GMAIL_CLIENT_ID"` references.
- Web UI setup instructions updated to show `settings.json` configuration directly (no more environment variable references)

### Fixed

- Trash operation now handles per-message failures gracefully — reports partial success instead of failing the entire batch
- Logout form body parsing no longer destroys the request socket on oversized payloads; returns HTTP 413 instead

### Removed

- `resolveEnv()` utility function (no longer needed after removing `env:` pattern support)
