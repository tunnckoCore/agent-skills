## 2.1.1

### Changes

- [#53](https://github.com/IgorWarzocha/howaboua-pi-stuff/pull/53) [`4c2e803`](https://github.com/IgorWarzocha/howaboua-pi-stuff/commit/4c2e803f3cc9d9fe7daa0e54f4548af536c8b472) Thanks [@IgorWarzocha](https://github.com/IgorWarzocha)! - Use OpenAI Codex subscription auth for Codex-backed web and image tools on all models, route image generation through the Codex image endpoints, and add optional image descriptions for text-only models.

## 2.1.0

### Changes

- [#50](https://github.com/IgorWarzocha/howaboua-pi-stuff/pull/50) [`a9bbba8`](https://github.com/IgorWarzocha/howaboua-pi-stuff/commit/a9bbba894a04bc43b4af9e31d68bd3323617b1b8) Thanks [@IgorWarzocha](https://github.com/IgorWarzocha)! - Add Codex reset-credit count and Ctrl+R reset action in the Usage tab.

  Theme the Codex adapter status label with Pi's active accent color and dim the status details.

  Show collapsed shell output previews and capped patch diffs, including PATH-mode `apply_patch` previews and native-style PATH tool call labels inside `exec_command`.

  Preserve raw shell behavior for PATH tool pipelines/redirections and use the active `exec_command` workdir for PATH `apply_patch` previews.

  Keep segmented PATH `apply_patch` rendering after failures while showing the actual shell error output instead of an optimistic diff preview.

  Surface captured `exec_bridge` startup stderr in `exec_command` failures.

  Document building bundled Codex tools from a Git checkout for older Linux compatibility.

  Update Pi development dependencies to 0.79.4, match Pi's Codex SSE timeout, and stop shrinking Codex model context windows.

## 2.0.1

### Changes

- [#42](https://github.com/IgorWarzocha/howaboua-pi-stuff/pull/42) [`f380d72`](https://github.com/IgorWarzocha/howaboua-pi-stuff/commit/f380d721c2fbd9956d730cae456aa7f38e4f0546) Thanks [@IgorWarzocha](https://github.com/IgorWarzocha)! - Ignore non-Responses thinking signatures when converting Codex context so Anthropic signatures do not crash JSON parsing.

## 2.0.0

### Breaking changes

- [#40](https://github.com/IgorWarzocha/howaboua-pi-stuff/pull/40) [`62a18db`](https://github.com/IgorWarzocha/howaboua-pi-stuff/commit/62a18dbd99346e76e77e610bbde2912854a4365b) Thanks [@IgorWarzocha](https://github.com/IgorWarzocha)! - Reworks Codex conversion around bundled Rust tool execution and adds a PATH mode.

  - Adds bundled cross-platform Rust binaries for `exec_command`, `write_stdin`, `apply_patch`, `view_image`, `web_run`, and `imagegen`.
  - Removes `node-pty` dependency.
  - Runs the toolkit through bundled binaries - very likely to help with stability - the tools will crash, but not Pi itself. Also improves maintainability - one implementation for all the tools/modes.
  - Adds PATH mode: Pi only exposes `exec_command` and `write_stdin` as JSON-schema tools, while `apply_patch`, `view_image`, `web_run`, and `imagegen` are available as shell commands on an extension-injected internal PATH (no changes to user PATH settings).
  - Tweaks to system prompt and JSON schema tool definitions to trim a few tokens here and there.
  - Reworks grouped `/codex` settings tabs for General, Tools, OpenAI, Usage, and About, including tool-rendering controls, PATH mode, web search model selection, fast mode, verbosity, cached WebSocket upgrade, native compaction settings, and usage display. Removes the confusing “apply patch for all GPT” switch; proxied providers should be named in scope instead.
  - Moves the native OAI compaction out of beta.

## 1.5.21

### Changes

- [#35](https://github.com/IgorWarzocha/howaboua-pi-stuff/pull/35) [`2f03bc0`](https://github.com/IgorWarzocha/howaboua-pi-stuff/commit/2f03bc04bfac5d7c41db7d3f53280baefa3a5ccc) Thanks [@IgorWarzocha](https://github.com/IgorWarzocha)! - Add the model-facing-api-design skill package.

  Fix Codex context budget adjustment so starting fresh sessions does not recursively shrink a reused model's displayed context window.

  Add a Proxy tools override for proxied providers, enabled by default, so Codex proxy users can choose whether listed providers receive native web search, image generation, and fast mode.

- [#35](https://github.com/IgorWarzocha/howaboua-pi-stuff/pull/35) [`2f03bc0`](https://github.com/IgorWarzocha/howaboua-pi-stuff/commit/2f03bc04bfac5d7c41db7d3f53280baefa3a5ccc) Thanks [@IgorWarzocha](https://github.com/IgorWarzocha)! - Add a configurable Codex background shell widget for running exec sessions, and use Pi's Windows shell resolution for default Codex exec sessions.

  Preserve Windows shell invocation semantics for cmd.exe and PowerShell-backed exec sessions.

- [#28](https://github.com/IgorWarzocha/howaboua-pi-stuff/pull/28) [`f852b3d`](https://github.com/IgorWarzocha/howaboua-pi-stuff/commit/f852b3d94d3d7551e59f1dfa323d9978383b68d1) Thanks [@IgorWarzocha](https://github.com/IgorWarzocha)! - Adds an `adapterProviders` setting for enabling the Codex adapter on named custom providers.

## 1.5.18

### Changes

- [#19](https://github.com/IgorWarzocha/howaboua-pi-stuff/pull/19) [`d312d81`](https://github.com/IgorWarzocha/howaboua-pi-stuff/commit/d312d81f82e24645f7cc59f4b6ead1834afd19f9) Thanks [@IgorWarzocha](https://github.com/IgorWarzocha)! - Align the custom OpenAI Codex provider with Pi 0.77 and 0.78 Responses fixes for explicit API-key handling, SSE abort cleanup, and fallback replay message IDs.

## 1.5.17

### Changes

- [#1](https://github.com/IgorWarzocha/howaboua-pi-stuff/pull/1) [`d57f0cb`](https://github.com/IgorWarzocha/howaboua-pi-stuff/commit/d57f0cbb5b92ce5cb7cf4736b6012c5ff0bebaae) Thanks [@IgorWarzocha](https://github.com/IgorWarzocha)! - Fix TypeScript errors under the shared workspace typecheck settings.

## 1.5.16

- Aligned OpenAI Codex custom-provider cache-affinity headers, timeout handling, reasoning effort options, Bun proxy WebSocket support, and development dependencies with Pi 0.76.
- Kept the extension's intentional hidden Codex provider retry behavior unchanged.

## 1.5.14-1.5.15

- Preserved cached WebSocket continuation reuse for OpenAI Codex requests when only the reasoning level changes.
- Added a Codex provider setting that upgrades explicit WebSocket transport to cached WebSocket transport without changing Pi's global transport preference or disabling `auto` SSE fallback behavior.
- Verified the cached WebSocket reasoning-change path against the live Codex provider with request-shape diagnostics enabled.
- Replaced cached WebSocket request-shape logging with a deterministic continuation-reuse test.

## 1.5.13

- Relaxed native compaction replay parity so the extension preserves the OpenAI compacted window using Pi's current provider payload when persisted session replay shape diverges.

## 1.5.12

- Hardened native Responses compaction replay after Pi fallback or compacted-window shape changes, preserving the previous native compacted window without aborting normal requests.
- Scoped native compacted-window injection to Pi compaction recovery requests so stale fallback state cannot leak into ordinary Responses requests.
- Improved compaction warnings for provider switching and recovery from failed native compaction.

## 1.5.11

- Aligned the custom OpenAI Codex provider and Pi development dependencies with Pi 0.75.4.
- Added Codex context-budget alignment so Pi auto-compaction for OpenAI Codex subscription models triggers near Codex's native 90% compacting threshold.
- Improved native Responses compaction fallback: failed native compactions now fall back to Pi compaction, and reuse the previous native compacted window when available.
- Pruned low-value compatibility tests while keeping focused coverage for adapter activation, native tools, compaction fallback, and Codex context budgeting.

## 1.5.10

- Added `/codex usage` and a Usage tab for OpenAI Codex subscription limits, with automatic refresh and aligned 5-hour/weekly usage columns.
- Moved settings links into a dedicated About tab.

## 1.5.9

- Fixed native Responses compaction replay when provider payloads include in-flight tail items that are not yet persisted in the session branch.

## 1.5.8

- Fixed native Responses compaction replay after compaction display messages so requests replace Pi placeholder compaction context with the native compacted window instead of failing parity checks.

## 1.5.7

- Fixed OpenAI Codex custom-provider requests so synthetic `web.run` and `image_generation` adapter tools are rewritten to native Responses tool payloads before sending.
- Fixed subagent and other RPC/no-session Codex runs failing with invalid function tool names when native web search is active.

## 1.5.6

- Added Compaction and Overrides tabs to `/codex`.
- Added optional native Responses compaction for Codex sessions, with settings for compaction model and reasoning.
- Added an `apply_patch`-only override mode for GPT/Codex models. This mode bypasses most of this extension, but still gives you the `apply_patch` tool.
- Renamed the native Codex web search tool from `web_search` to responses-native `web.run`, allowing compatibility with other extensions.
- Synced the custom OpenAI Codex provider and Pi development dependencies with Pi `0.75.3`.

## 1.5.5

- Avoid registering disabled native `web_search` and `image_generation` tools so other extensions can own those names.
- Preserve other extensions' `web_search` and `image_generation` tools when the matching Codex feature is off.
- Added a `/codex status` toggle and settings UI option for hiding the Codex footer/statusline.

## 1.5.4

- Added `/codex` settings UI.
- Added saved global config at `~/.pi/agent/pi-codex-conversion.json`.
- Added toggles for fast mode, native web search, native image generation, and using the adapter on all models.
- Added verbosity control for Responses API providers.
- Added footer status details for active Codex settings.
- Added quick links from the settings UI to GitHub, Discord, and issue filing.
- Updated Pi development dependencies to 0.74.1.

## 1.5.3

## 1.5.2

- Streamed partial `exec_command` updates while commands are still running.
- Improved background terminal responsiveness and display state.

## 1.5.1

- Cleaned up the Codex adapter prompt and tool surface.
